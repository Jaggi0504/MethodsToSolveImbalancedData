In this project, I focused on dealing with the imbalanced dataset. Imbalanced dataset is pretty common to find in solving the real-world problems. Example:
1. Finance: Fraud detection, Credit risk assessment
2. Healthcare: Rare disease prediction
3. Consumer internet: Churn Prediction

In this project, I have worked on Churn Prediction where people who leaves are only ~20% and rest are still the customers. 
Since, the dataset was highly imbalanced, so there are few methods I used to deal with it:
1. Undersampling
2. Oversampling
3. SMOTE (Synthetic Minority OverSampling Technique)
4. Ensemble Learning
